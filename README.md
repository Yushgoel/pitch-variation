# Detecting Pitch Variation
Detecting Pitch Variation Programmatically


The .m4a and .wav files are the same, just different format. I recorded it in proprietary software, so had to convert it.

- "hello.wav" - Me saying hello.
- "hello_stretch.wav" - Me saying hel-lo (essentially different intonation). 
- "hello_long.wav" - Me saying hello followed by silence for background noise.
- "test.m4a" - sample audio (recorded this recently. Will use it after doing more testing on single words).
